                        <p><strong>Hi!</strong> My name is Karina Lee and 
                        I am a second year computer engineering major. I enjoy listening to music (literally all types of genres) 
                    and going out with my friends. I love eating all kinds of food and trying new ones as well. I grew up in Colorado and then 
                    moved to Portland, Oregon where I lived there for 9 years. I like going to the gym and doing very active things such as hiking and rock climbing.
                    I hope to get into running this summer. My favorite movies are <em> GoodWill Hunting</em>. And my favorite book is <em> Educated</em> by Tara Westover.
